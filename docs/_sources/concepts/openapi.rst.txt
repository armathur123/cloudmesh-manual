OpenAPI Web Services
====================

Cloudmesh contains a mechanism to automatically generate REST services
from simple python functions and classes.

The details about this concept are discussed at:

* https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-openapi/blob/master/README.md

The generated code includes a simple REST service, as well as the
needed OpenAPI 3 YAML file so it can be used for generating clients
in arbitrary languages. It also allows the documented display of the
REST service.
